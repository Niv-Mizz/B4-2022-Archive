2021 was the year we had the best autonomous yet.
It was our first year using Roadrunner, and my (Matthew) last year.
Roadrunner enabled localization and our trajectories.
We also used some advanced roadrunner concepts, like asynchronous trajectory following, and MeepMeep.
We also used OpenCV for our webcam detection.
We didn't need to use roadrunner in teleop, but we tested it some.
In our teleop we had an "endgame mode", which was helpful for all the complicated things in endgame.
